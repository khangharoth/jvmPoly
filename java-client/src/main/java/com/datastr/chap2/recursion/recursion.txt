Recursion is useful technique borrowed from mathematics.


recursion vs iteration : recursion is easier to reason about but may take more space.
generally iterative solutions are more efficient than recursion .

Any problem that can be solved recursively can also be solved iteratively.
For some problems there are no obvious iterative algorithms.

Backtracking is a method of exhaustive search using divide and conquer.
